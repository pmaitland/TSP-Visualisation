**Have done**
- implemented nearest neighbour in js
- add tracking of steps taken by algorithm to nn implementation

**Plan to**
- improve tracking of steps (don't use a list to pass info)
- start visualisation with nn

---

- begin by implementing visualisation using nearest neighbour
- hard code a distance matrix and don't worry about user input
- if not using euclidean distance, could arrange vertices in a circle
- if a complete graph, edges don't need to be displayed
- display edges when a node is selected

- animation steps would probably be better as objects rather than enums
- look at what js inheritance is capable of
- steps might store a description, vertices involved, colour of vertices/edges involved, current line in pseudocode
- different algorithms will require different types of steps, but will share some too
- think about how steps will be reversed and how this is stored
