**Have done:**
- Existing software
  - VISUALGO
  - Concorde
  - TSP Solver and Generator
- Read some of Applegate's book

**Plan to:**
- Study algorithms
- Write up requirements
- Set up repo and email summer reading

---

VISUALGO looks visually appealing and the inclusion of pseudocode is good. Animation falls short with lack of visualisation for calculating min spanning trees/euclidian tour. Poor usability when plotting graph (allowing edges to be created when they shouldn't be, not allowing three or more collinear nodes). Maximum of 8 nodes is too few.

Uni of Munich's presentation as game makes it appealing. Good that it includes descriptions of the algorithms.

Maybe not worthwhile including Tookan and Routific. They might not add anything the others examples don't already.

Could implement simulated annealing in the future, but is not a high priority.

Summarise existing TSP software into a table containing their features and how they are implemented.

Write up requirements (MoSCoW) based on what has been seen in existing software.

Draw wireframes of UI to get an idea for how things will be laid out and presented to the user.
