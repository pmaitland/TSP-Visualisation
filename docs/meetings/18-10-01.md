**Have done**
- Wrote up initial requirements
- Drew general wireframes
- Looked into js libraries which could be suitable for implementation

**Plan to**
- Look more at js libraries
- Draw wireframes of animations
- Begin implementation of 'must have' algorithms

---

**Requirements**
- split animation controls requirement into multiple parts. play and pause will be simpler to implement than stepping through the animation
- move christofides and approx with min weight spanning trees to should have and move nearest neighbour and brute force to must have. this should be done to match the order they would be easiest implemented

**Wireframes**
- distance matrix would be a worthwhile inclusion for changing edge weights as a large number of nodes would mean a lot of edges, and changing edge weights via the canvas would become difficult
- keep descriptions of algorithms short. they aren't vital to the project
- dedicate more space to the pseudocode once an algorithm has been selected
- either in algorithms tab or elsewhere, show more information while the algorithm is running; current sub-tour length, length of best tour found so far, information on intermediate steps of christofides and approximation with min weight spanning tree algorithms
- don't run all algorithms at once!!!
- in results tab, initially display only the results of the selected algorithm. allow the user to run another algorithm and then display its result alongside the previous results
- final tour for each algorithm chosen, not just the first
- include options to save results in either the results tab or a new 'output' tab
- rename graph tab to 'input'
- doesn't matter if final product looks nothing like wireframes. they exist merely for initial reference and we won't know which layout works best until we try to use it

**Implementation**
- continue looking into js libraries
- if graph is complete, perhaps edges don't need to be shown at all until used in algorithm
- look into curved edges; if three nodes are collinear and an edge in the final tour exists between the two outside nodes, we don't want it to look like it includes the middle node in the tour at this point
