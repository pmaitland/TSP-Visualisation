**Have Done**
- divided config into tabs
- added pseudocode
- added new animation step to show searching for nearest neighbour
- added buttons to reset animation and jump to end
- reduced distance matrix to triangle
- allowed vertices and distances

**Questions**
- which distance matrix is preferable?
- should probably make distance matrix top row and left most column 'sticky'
- is pseudocode accurate?

**Plan to**
- implement creation of graphs in euclidean space

---

- distance matrix would look better as a square
- make top row and left column sticky
- add tooltip to each cell which contains it's relevant vertices
- have consistency in cell dimensions (a column with max one character should still be the same width as a column with more than one character)

- show vertex labels on graph

- make changes to nearest neighbour pseudocode so that it's simpler

- read in instances from file
- use tsplib format
- could create own format for non-euclidean
  - number of vertices followed by distance matrix
  - simply just a distance matrix

- allow user to plot euclidean instance with mouse
- use dimensions of canvas by default to calculate distances
- allow user to override dimensions, meaning greater distances are possible
- possibly draw grid lines or something similar to show scale
- make vertices smaller, but maintain their size regardless of scale
