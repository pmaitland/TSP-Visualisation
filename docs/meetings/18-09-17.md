Decided to look at existing TSP visualisations. This will allow me to think about which aspects of them I'd like to implement myself and which to avoid, as well as think of things they miss out which would make positive additions.

Looked at slides on integer programming (DLS-L1.ppt, slides 24-26) and discussed possibly visualising this at a later stage.

Decided to familiarise myself with the algorithms which could be visualised:
- Brute force
- Nearest neighbour
- Branch and bound
- Approximation using minimum weight spanning trees
- Christofides

Briefly spoke about what a UI might look like (e.g. how information is laid out on the screen, animation controls, etc.) and mentioned that wireframes would be useful.

Agreed a suitable approach would be to run through an algorithm once without displaying anything to the user while storing the steps taken. These steps could then be stepped through automatically or manually at the users own pace and direction.
