**Have done**

- Distance matrix is a square again
- Allowed switching between euclidean and non-euclidean space
- Vertices can be plotted in euclidean space by clicking the canvas

**Questions**

- Moving vertices in euclidean space
  - allow vertices on the canvas to be dragged and relocated
  - show a list of all vertices and their coords in the config area and allow these to be edited
- edge weights can be difficult to read in euclidean space because they can be very close to each other
- how should euclidean distances be rounded (currently rounded to nearest whole number)

**Plan to**

- show list of vertices and their coords in config area
- allow generation of graph from file
  - non euclidean space just needs a distance matrix e.g.:
  ```
  0 1 5 3
  1 0 7 4
  5 7 0 6
  3 4 6 0
  ```
  - euclidean space needs vertex coords e.g.:
  ```
  13 4
  16 2
  4 5
  77 3
  ```
- allow saving of graph to file

---

- dont focus on more user input at the moment
- begin implementing branch and bound (with nearest neighbour bound)

- when a vertex is selected and it's edges are shown, if an edge/edge label is moused over then highlight the edge and label

- look at creating random graphs
  - in euclidean space
    - when placing a vertex, disallow another vertex from being placed in an area around it
    - make sure that a vertex doesn't appear in the restricted area of any other vertex
    - this ensures that no two vertices are too close together
  - this will give an idea of how many vertices the user should be allowed to plot

- in euclidean space, display the mouse coords at all times so that the user knows where they're plotting

- in euclidean space, have a drop down on right click which provides options to delete the vertex and edit it's coords
