**Have Done**
- changed animation steps to use classes
- added buttons to play, pause, and step through the animation

**Plan to**
- implement support for euclidean space

---

- show vertex label next to vertex

- add an animation step to show that vertices are being searched for nearest neighbour

- store the line of pseudocode a step represents on the step itself
- add pseudocode sooner rather than later; this will change the animation step classes

- look at tsplib and how it could be utilised
  - this is for importing/exporting instances

- have independent modes for plotting euclidean and non-euclidean graphs
- non-euclidean uses a distance matrix
  - set the number of vertices
  - populate the distance matrix
  - graph is drawn as a circle of vertices
- euclidean uses the mouse on the canvas
  - user clicks to place a vertex
  - distances are based on euclidean distance between nodes
  - distance matrix is still displayed but not editable by user
