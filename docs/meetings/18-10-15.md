- don't redraw the canvas constantly; only when a step takes place
- think about how steps will be reversed

- edit edge weights through the canvas and the distance matrix

- have one mode for euclidean space and one for non-euclidean space

- focus on cleaning up visualisation implementation and algorithm steps first in preparation for more algorithms
- focus on user input and more algorithms later
